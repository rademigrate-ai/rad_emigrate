"""GRAPH_REPORT's headline numbers must agree with themselves (#3148, #3548).

The Summary and Communities headers counted thin communities against the
caller's --min-community-size, while the Knowledge Gaps section counted
against a hardcoded 3 - beside label text that already printed
min_community_size. And the "isolated node(s)" figure excludes file,
concept and rationale nodes without saying so, so a plain degree<=1 recount
from graph.json never matched it. Also the #2129 residual: "shown" was
total-minus-thin, which counted zero-real-node communities the render loop
skips.

#3548: fixing the #2129 residual by computing "shown" directly (instead of
total-minus-thin) then left "thin" itself undercounting - a `0 <` guard
excluded a zero-real-node community from "thin" too, so a community the
render loop also skips went uncounted anywhere. `shown + thin` no longer
summed to the total. Both thresholds below now count the all-file-node
community ("onlyfile") as thin at every positive min_community_size, since
0 is always less than it.
